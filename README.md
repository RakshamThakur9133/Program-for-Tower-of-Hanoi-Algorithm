# Tower of Hanoi
This is a simple implementation of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle in [programming language]. The Tower of Hanoi is a classic puzzle in which you are given three pegs and a number of disks of different sizes. The objective is to move all the disks from the source peg to the destination peg, following these rules:

Only one disk can be moved at a time.
A disk can only be placed on top of a larger disk or on an empty peg.
The disks can be moved between the pegs.
# Features
Solve the Tower of Hanoi puzzle using recursive algorithms.
Option to choose the number of disks.
Display the moves required to solve the puzzle.
[Optional] Visual representation of the puzzle state (if implemented).
